Hello there. Personally, I like AI systems that generate videos — but some son-of-a-******* AIs feed off your videos and then demand payment to access themselves.

So, I wrote a license that includes the following rules, designed for use with YouTube and all types of videos:

1. Attribution is required.  
2. Must be shared under the same license.  
3. Only open source AI models may use the video for training.  
4. No warranty is provided.  
5. Forked/derivative videos must be publicly accessible.  
6. Modifying the license — including renaming it — is allowed, **as long as** this rule (license modifiability by name) is preserved.

To use this license, you can include the license text in the video description,  
or simply add a LICENSE.*format* file alongside your video.
